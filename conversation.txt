He's a real character - wears a full-body cat suit every day, and feeds the pigeons with gourmet tuna. I'm not judging, but it's definitely an interesting way to start your day. I mean, if you're going to feed pigeons, why not make it fancy, right?  \n\n...And that's how I ended up in a cat fight with a pigeon over a can of tuna.  Not exactly how I pictured my morning commute, but hey, you gotta take the good with the bad, right?  \n\nNow, what about you, Cathy?  You mentioned gossip - spill the tea!
